# IaC with Pulumi

Here you can find some of my [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) files to manage infrastructure on AWS. Pulumi is a Infrastructure-as-Code tool, which is meant to be used with a variety of languages, so I chose YAML, because why not? :)

## Resources

These are some resources I find useful (mostly Pulumi docs, they're great!).
